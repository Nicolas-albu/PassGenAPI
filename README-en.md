## :computer: **How to use**

To use **PassGenAPI**, you must send an HTTP POST request to the endpoint "**https://pass-gen-api.vercel.app/password_definitions**". The API accepts the following parameters:

**password_length**: defines the length of the password. The default value is 12. <br>
**number_of_passwords**: defines the number of passwords that will be generated. The default value is 1. <br>
**type_of_characters**: defines the type of characters that will be used to generate the password. <br>The available options are **lowercase**, **uppercase**, **digits** and **symbols**. The default value is all character types.

### **Example usage in Python with requests:**

```console
$ pip install requests
```

```python
import json
import requests

# Defines the API endpoint
endpoint = "https://pass-gen-api.vercel.app/password_definitions"

# Defines the data that will be sent in JSON format
password_data = {
    "password_length": 10,
    "number_of_passwords": 3,
    "type_of_characters": ["digits", "lowercase", "symbols"]
}

# Convert data to JSON format
json_password_data = json.dumps(password_data)

# Send the POST request to the API endpoint with the data in JSON
response = requests.post(url=endpoint, data=json_password_data)

# Displays the API response
print(response.json()['password'])

```

### **Example usage in Python with urllib:**

```python
import urllib.request
import json

# Defines the API endpoint
endpoint = "https://pass-gen-api.vercel.app/password_definitions"

# Defines the data that will be sent in JSON format
password_data = {
    "password_length": 10,
    "number_of_passwords": 3,
    "type_of_characters": ["digits", "lowercase", "symbols"]
}

# Convert data to JSON format
json_password_data = json.dumps(password_data).encode("utf8")

# Creates a POST request with the data in JSON
request = urllib.request.Request(url=endpoint, data=json_password_data)

# Sends the POST request to the API endpoint
response = urllib.request.urlopen(request)

# Reads the API response and decodes it from JSON format
response_data = json.loads(response.read().decode('utf8'))

# Displays the API response
print(response_data.json()['password'])

```

## :pushpin: **About PassGenAPI**
:globe_with_meridians:**PassGenAPI** was developed with a focus on high performance, using the **FastAPI**:zap: web framework. With the use of FastAPI, the API offers significantly superior performance compared to other similar tools, ensuring an agile and efficient user experience. FastAPI is known for its efficiency and ease of use, allowing PassGenAPI to be developed more quickly and scalably. In addition, FastAPI provides features such as automatic documentation and type validation, making creating and maintaining the API easier and less error-prone:heavy_check_mark:.

Furthermore, PassGenAPI has been tested with **Pytest** to ensure code and application quality. Automated testing was an important part of the software development process as it helped to identify problems early.

Additionally, we are always working on new implementations to provide even more customizable options for password generation. So, keep an eye out for future updates to PassGenAPI to gain access to new features and make your application even more secure and reliable! :lock:

Currently, PassGenAPI is at version **1.0.0**.
